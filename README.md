This program lets you select a region of your screen, uses OCR to read the text, and copies the text to your clipboard.

# Usage:
1) First download and install [tesseract](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki). 
2) Make sure you have pytesseract and PIL libraries installed. 
3) Open main.py and locate tesseract.exe (you only have to do this once).
4) Click and drag over a region you want to copy text from. 

Only supports single monitor use.
